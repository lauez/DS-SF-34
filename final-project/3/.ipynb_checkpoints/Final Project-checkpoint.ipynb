    "\n",
    "Where are people traveling to more frequently based on user types. Specifically, those going to Las Vegas or Orlando. The assumption is older travelers will go to Las Vegas, while more families with young children will go to Orlando. These two locations were picked because they bring in the most revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "I work at a company in the travel industry. Many of our clients are concerned about how to spend their marketing budget. Since we collect data on their travelers, we should be able to advise them on where certain groups of people visit more often.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other background information?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why Las Vegas and Orlando were selected is because they bring in the most revenue for this particular client. This project can then be elaborated in the future to provide more insights on different destinations and user groups. \n",

    "\n",
    "The OOB is fairly high for this model, approximately 0.923. And the top predictive features used in this model is the booking window, total number of passengers, and adults. These were the top three metrics that was highly correlated to Las Vegas.\n",

    "\n",
    "To move this project forward, I would continue to see if there are other metrics that could improve the predictability power of the model. Though the OOB is around 0.9, there is still room for improvement and I believe it could go up even more, especially if I were to continue this modeling with more than two destinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would also test for clustering to see if that would show specific types of people more obviously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the training data is historical and the test data is more recent, there could be a change in purchasing behavior. This changes the analysis a bit since there's a time component to the data. I would possibly also dive into a time series model, predicting volume of a destination over time."
