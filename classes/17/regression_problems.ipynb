    "The purpose of this problem set is to put your regression skills to the test. As a GA student of data science, you have covered a number of sklearn regression techniques, so now is your chance to apply them. We'll be using the Boston Housing Dataset. Just kidding. I know you hate that one. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be exploring the relationships between sugar, economics, and teeth. You are given a dataset containing sugar consuption, healthcare spending, per capita GDP, literacy rate and the number of bad teeth per child across several hundred countries. What do you think? If you get richer, do your teeth get worse from more sugary foods, or better with health care assistance? Does education improve health, or drive excess? \n",
